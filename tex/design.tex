The application is made up of activities, retainable fragments, and different types of listeners. When starting the application, the first screen visible to the player is the main menu defined in MainActivity, which contains three buttons: Play, Instructions and Highscore. The buttons navigate from the MainActivity to the corresponding activities within the application. 

When the instruction button is pressed, a slideshow of images appear in Instructions-Activity to inform the user about the rules. The user can navigate through the images by sliding left or right. \newline

When the play button is pressed the user is led into the PhotoActivity where the user picks a bonus card, which can either be a default card or a personal photo taken with the device’s default camera application. To be able to use this, the application uses the camera permission. \newline

After the user has made his or her choice the GameActivity appears and the game begins. When the game is over, the user can either go to the main menu or stay in GameActivity to play again. If the user’s score is high enough to make it into the highscore list, the user can submit the score and enter HighscoreActivity. This activity is as previously mentioned also accessible from the main menu. \newline

To handle a part of the game logic, we have used a retainable fragment with an AsyncTask. This fragment is called VerifyFragment and it checks the type of interaction that the user has done and whether the two images are identical or not. Another fragment used in the game is DialogFragment called FinishDialogFragment, whose options change based on the player’s score as previously mentioned in this section. \newline

The buttons in PhotoActivity are ImageViews with added OnClickListeners, while OnTouchListener is mainly used for the fling gesture in the game and the instructions menu. Within the OnTouchListener we have a custom gesture listener to have full control over the different types of gestures available within the GameActivity and the InstructionsActivity.
