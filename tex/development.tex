\section{Development process}
Following the MoSCoW model from the analysis section, the first things implemented were the game logic, timer and score from the Must column. Since we had time left, the Should and Could functions were also added afterwards and additional game ideas such as ''Rush Hour'' mode.
The way the CountDownTimer is implemented during "Rush Hour" is very complicated, because as mentioned earlier, the application crashed when we tried to add another timer. Therefore we had to implement the CountDownTimer in a very inefficient way, so the application could run. This could be improved a lot if we had more time.
