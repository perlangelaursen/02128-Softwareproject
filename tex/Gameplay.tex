\section{Gameplay}
The essence of the application is to match two cards, a reference card and a matching card. The user has to slide up to skip when the two cards don’t match, and slide down to keep two matching cards. If the bonus card or “Rush Hour” card appears, the user has to double-tap on the card. The bonus card gives five extra points, and the “Rush Hour” card gives a 5 second “Rush Hour"-round.
