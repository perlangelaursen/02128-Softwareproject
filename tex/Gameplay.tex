\section{Gameplay}
The essence of the application is to match two cards. There is a reference card and a random card to match. If the two cards matches, the user has to slide down to “keep”, and if the two cards doesn’t match, the user has to slide up to “skip”. If the bonus card or “Rush Hour” card appears, the user has to double-tap for extra points or features. The bonus card gives five extra points, and the “Rush Hour” card pauses the time and give the user 5 seconds to skip/keep as many cards as possible, and get 1 point for each card.
