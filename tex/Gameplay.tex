The essence of the application is to match two cards: a reference card and a card from the player's deck. The user has to swipe up to skip when the two cards do not match, and swipe down to keep two matching cards. If the bonus card or “Rush Hour” card appears, the user has to double tap on the card. The bonus card gives five extra points, and the “Rush Hour” card gives a 5 second “Rush Hour"-round.
